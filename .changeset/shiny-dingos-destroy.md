Build esm and cjs outputs.

Package build now outputs both formats, which means that entry directories need to contain a package.json to route to the correct version.
These entry package.json files are autogenerated on each build (and don't get committed), but the parent package.json needs to be updated manually, because it is committed.

@crackle/cli now provides "fix" to update the parent package.json.
